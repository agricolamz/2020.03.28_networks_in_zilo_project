## Introduction

* In Variationism (e.g. [@labov63] on Martha's Vineyard /ai/ ~ /au/, [@trudgill74] on Norwich speech, [@wolfram69] on Afro-American speech from Detroit) researchers get mad about social stratification, mostly urban.

* Unfortunately, social stratification could be not the only factor that play the role (gender, age, social conntection). The next step is to investigate social networks of speakers ([@chambers95] cited after [@dorian10]):
    * the family circle
    * classmates and close friends
    * (my suggestion) coworkers?

* [@dorian10] provided such a results of her study on small group of Gaelic speakers, where she evaluated variation within age groups, gender, sibling groups and a self-identified peer groups

## Zilo

* Zilo ([zilo1238](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/zilo1238)) is one village (Botlikh district, Dagestan) dialect of Andi (Nakh-Daghestanian, Andic, [andi1255](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/andi1255))
* The Zilo dialect has been investigated by several researches since 2016. The results of their research should be summarised in [@zilosketch].
* The variation in Zilo was investigated in several works:
    * class atribution [@moroz19], 16 speakers, age effect, no gender effect
    * more variables from phonology, noun and verbal morphology and lexicon [@moroz20], 44 speakers, no age or gender effect
    
## Project proposal

* A new variation questionary taking into account previous findings and adding more question of possible variation (alongside of non-variational questions)
* Additional questionary about social networks:
    * Who are your freinds, you are meet really often with?
    * How often did you see/talk with X? (and then a long list speakers)
    * Where do you meet? (guests, rare family gathering or phone calls, friends gathering, etc)

>- I will obtain an approximation of the part of the social structure of Zilo. It makes possible:
>    - to run centrality analysis and other network measures;
>    - to estimate the relations of the variability of Zilo and Zilo speakers social structure
>    - to answer the question, whether it is possible to reconstruct social structure using obtained variables
